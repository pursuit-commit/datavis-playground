# Getting Started with Data Visualization

The datavis-playground is built to allow the developer to play with a pre-canned dataset of movie data ([IMDB Movie Data](/src/assets/imdb_data.json)). In [App.tsx](/src/App.tsx), you will see that we have provided 3 sample charts (contained in the [charts folder](/src/charts)), you can choose to build on top of these by editing a chart file. Or you can create a new component in the charts folder and import it into the App component.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). 

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
